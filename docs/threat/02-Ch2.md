# Chapter 2: Tools and Technologies for Threat Hunting

## The Role of Automation in Threat Hunting

In the modern cybersecurity landscape, automation plays an essential role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of threat hunting. While automation tools cannot replace human judgment and intuition, they can help **streamline routine tasks** such as data collection, log parsing, and initial analysis. This allows threat hunters to focus their efforts on more complex tasks, like identifying subtle indicators of compromise (IOCs) and analyzing complex attack vectors.

Key areas where automation can assist include:
- **Log aggregation and normalization**: Collecting logs from multiple systems and transforming them into a usable format.
- **Alert triaging**: Sorting through large numbers of alerts and helping to prioritize high-risk incidents.
- **IOC enrichment**: Automatically cross-referencing suspicious indicators against external threat intelligence sources.

In this chapter, we will explore several key tools that integrate automation into the threat hunting workflow, making it easier to detect and respond to emerging threats.
