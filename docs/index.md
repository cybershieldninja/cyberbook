# üìö Cybersecurity & Cloud Engineering Series

Welcome to our multi-book series dedicated to professionals in cybersecurity, cloud architecture, and infrastructure engineering.

              
## üîç [Threat Analysis & Hunting](threat/index.md)
Threat hunting is a proactive approach in cybersecurity, focused on detecting threats that evade traditional security solutions. This chapter introduces core concepts, methodologies, and the value threat hunting brings to modern organizations.

## üîì [Vulnerability Management](vm/index.md)

In cybersecurity, the term "vulnerable" refers to a weakness or flaw in a system, software, hardware, or network that could be exploited by a threat actor (like a hacker or malicious entity) to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or perform malicious actions.

Types of Vulnerabilities

Buffer Overflow: When more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, causing memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.

SQL Injection: An attacker injects malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate or steal data from a database.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts are injected into websites, which then execute in a victim‚Äôs browser, potentially stealing cookies, session data, or other sensitive information.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers trick a user into making an unwanted request, such as changing account details, by exploiting their authenticated session.

Privilege Escalation: Attackers gain higher privileges (like root or administrator access) by exploiting flaws in the OS or software.

Denial of Service (DoS): Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to overwhelm a system with excessive requests, causing it to become unresponsive.

Race Condition: A situation where multiple processes try to access or modify the same resource simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior or unauthorized access.

Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: A flaw that is unknown to the vendor or the public and can be exploited before it‚Äôs patched (hence, "zero-day").

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): An attacker can access or modify resources they shouldn‚Äôt be able to by manipulating the URL or request parameters.

Misconfiguration: Improperly configured security settings, permissions, or firewall rules, such as leaving default passwords or exposing sensitive services to the internet.
