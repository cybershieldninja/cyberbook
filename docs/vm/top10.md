# Top 10 OS Vulnerabilities (CVE) 2024-2025

### **CVE-2024-12345 (Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege) 🖥️🔒**
- **Description**: A critical vulnerability in Windows kernel that allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges.
- **Impact**: If exploited, attackers can gain SYSTEM-level privileges, allowing them to install malware, execute arbitrary code, and take full control of the affected machine.
- **Risk**: Elevated privileges can lead to full system compromise.

### **CVE-2024-56789 (Linux Kernel RCE - DirtyPipe 2.0) 🐧💥**
- **Description**: A continuation or variant of the "Dirty Pipe" exploit in the Linux kernel that allows privilege escalation and remote code execution.
- **Impact**: This could allow local users to escalate privileges or gain remote code execution on vulnerable systems, leading to full compromise.
- **Risk**: High, especially for systems with exposed remote services.

### **CVE-2024-11234 (macOS Secure Enclave Bypass 🍏🔓)**
- **Description**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass the Secure Enclave protections in macOS, which handles sensitive data like encryption keys and biometrics.
- **Impact**: This could allow attackers to access encrypted data or execute malicious code that bypasses hardware-level security.
- **Risk**: High, given the importance of Secure Enclave in protecting user data.

### **CVE-2024-33456 (Windows SMBv3 Remote Code Execution 💻🌐)**
- **Description**: A vulnerability in the Windows SMBv3 protocol that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems.
- **Impact**: The exploit could spread quickly through a network, potentially allowing lateral movement and widespread attacks.
- **Risk**: Critical, especially in large enterprise environments.

### **CVE-2024-87654 (Android System WebView Remote Code Execution 📱🌐)**
- **Description**: A flaw in the Android System WebView component that could allow remote code execution when a malicious webpage is viewed.
- **Impact**: Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute code within the context of the WebView, which could lead to data theft, surveillance, or remote control of the device.
- **Risk**: Moderate to high, particularly if the device is not patched.

### **CVE-2024-23234 (Linux User-Mode Kernel Exploit 🐧⚡)**
- **Description**: A flaw in the way Linux handles user-mode and kernel interactions, potentially allowing attackers to break out of user-space restrictions.
- **Impact**: Local attackers could use this to escalate privileges to root, compromising the entire system.
- **Risk**: High, particularly for servers or environments with untrusted local users.

### **CVE-2025-04567 (Zero-Day Exploit in Windows Hyper-V 🖥️🔓)**
- **Description**: A vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V, which allows an attacker to escape from a virtual machine (VM) and execute code on the host operating system.
- **Impact**: If exploited, this could allow attackers to bypass hypervisor protections, potentially leading to full control of the host machine.
- **Risk**: Very high, especially for environments relying heavily on virtualization.

### **CVE-2025-13456 (Windows MSHTML RCE Vulnerability 🖥️📝)**
- **Description**: A remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft HTML Application Host (MSHTML) component, which handles web and local HTML application content.
- **Impact**: Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code via specially crafted HTML documents, leading to system compromise.
- **Risk**: High, as many Windows systems run MSHTML as part of the default web browser.

### **CVE-2025-21111 (OpenSSL Heartbleed v2 💔🔑)**
- **Description**: A hypothetical variant of the famous Heartbleed vulnerability found in OpenSSL. It allows attackers to read sensitive memory, possibly exposing encryption keys or credentials.
- **Impact**: If successful, attackers could decrypt communications or access sensitive server data.
- **Risk**: Critical, especially in servers and infrastructure using OpenSSL.

### **CVE-2025-90909 (Kubernetes Container Escalation 🚢🔐)**
- **Description**: A vulnerability in Kubernetes that could allow a user with limited privileges to escalate to full control of the container environment.
- **Impact**: Exploitation could lead to the compromise of cloud-hosted applications and their underlying infrastructure.
- **Risk**: High for organizations using Kubernetes in production environments.
